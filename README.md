# CISC 7700X HW 7
Homework repo for HW#7 for CISC 7700X Class

Compile for Data: g++ -o conversion conversion.cpp

Making the Data files: ./conversion

Compile: g++ -o main main.cpp

Run: ./main

Running the KNN classifier from HW 6 (the KNN classifier) on the MNIST dataset takes too long so I ran it on 1500 entries only. That said it only achieves an accuracy of 3.133% as well, so this was not a good classifier to test the MNIST dataset on.
